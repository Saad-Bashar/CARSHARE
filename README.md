# CARSHARE

First of all, a great weekend building this app ;) Hope I fulfill the app requirements. I am going to list down what I have done in the app.

## Update & Improvement

As per the discussio with Apo, tried to improve on few things which are listed below:

### Signin & Signup functionalities

1. User can sign in or sign up, I did not create seperate sceen for sign up for the demo. If user does not have already an account a new account will be created for them when they sign in with their email & Password.

2. Validation in Signin

3. Separate Redux module for user authentication

### Separate Route

1. Now only the signed in user can go to the main app. 

### Reservation Form

1. Restructured the whole reservation form

### Design Improvement

1. Few design improvments, added background images in few screens and fix small issues related to design.


## Install and Run
I built the app using **Expo** (Why? I will tell the reason later in this readme). So it is very easy to run the app. All you need is Expo Client in your mobile and scan the QRCODE to run the app. 

**Expo Link for the demo project** - [Demo](https://expo.io/@saad-bashar/SOCAR)


## What I have done
I will list down the screens and write briefly about the main functionalities of them

### Splash Screen 

Added a very simple splash screen with SOCAR logo.

2. Marker onhover more info

2. Swipe car item right to reserve or swipe left to see next car.

2. Date and hours to reserve a car
3. functionality to reseve a car

2. Collapsible list to show **FAQ**

### What I have not done

Since the requirements were to just create a car reservation system, I did not do the user authentication. So right now assuming that the app does not have any user for the demo purpose.

### Debugging

![debug](https://github.com/Saad-Bashar/CARSHARE/blob/master/assets/screenshots/debug.png)


Debugging is one the most important tasks to do in RN projects. I used react native debugger extension tool to debug my code. This extenstion is super cool, because in real time I can see all my app redux data, state, actions and also inspect styling at the same time. 

### Few mentionable points:

1.I used react-redux-firebase so the app's redux store is automatically connected to the firebase. So I do not manually need to call any redux actions to dispatch to firebase

2.Even though expo is not really a good choice for production level app, but in order to make a demo for this test this has been the best option since it can bootstap the app real quick.

### My Limitations: 
Even though I have been given 5 days for this test, I had to finish it within this 2 days during the weekends since from next week I have my Master's final exams coming! So I could not manage to do extensive testing on real devices, the animation might be a little buggy in physical devices specially on android. But overall, I really enjoyed working on this.
